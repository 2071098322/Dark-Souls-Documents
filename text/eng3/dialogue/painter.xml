<text id="53000000">I believe...I feel the scent of ash upon thee.</text>
<text id="53000001">Thou'rt the one of whom uncle Gael spoke.</text>
<text id="53000002">The one to show me flame.</text>
<text id="53000100">Tis good. When this is done, may I return.</text>
<text id="53000101">The door is open thanks to thee.</text>
<text id="53000200">Tis good. I'll head off to paint.</text>
<text id="53000201">I promised uncle Gael I would.</text>
<text id="53000300">Worry not,</text>
<text id="53000301">I cannot die.</text>
<text id="53000400">Thou'rt Ash.</text>
<text id="53000401">Thou'st a pact made with uncle Gael.</text>
<text id="53000402">So I wish to tell thee all.</text>
<text id="53000403">Behold its size. This is my canvas.</text>
<text id="53000404">It's to be a cold, dark, and very gentle place.</text>
<text id="53000405">...But first, I must see flame.</text>
<text id="53000500">I wish to paint a picture.</text>
<text id="53000501">Of a cold, dark, and very gentle place.</text>
<text id="53000502">One day, it will make someone a goodly home.</text>
<text id="53000503">That's why I must see flame.</text>
<text id="53000600">Those who aren't ken to fire cannot paint a world.</text>
<text id="53000601">Those absorbed by fire, must not paint a world.</text>
<text id="53000602">Don't worry, I haven't forgotten, Mother...</text>
<text id="53000700">I can hear the fire crackle...</text>
<text id="53000701">And soon, I will see it...</text>
<text id="53000800">My thanks, Ashen One.</text>
<text id="53000801">I will finish the painting.</text>
<text id="53000802">Of a cold, dark, and very gentle place.</text>
<text id="53000803">So that it might make a home for someone, someday.</text>
<text id="53000900">My thanks, Ashen One.</text>
<text id="53000901">I can almost see the flame.</text>
<text id="53000902">Soon uncle Gael will bring me the pigment.</text>
<text id="53000903">I wonder if he has found it?</text>
<text id="53000904">The dark soul of man...</text>
<text id="53001000">I wonder if uncle Gael has found it?</text>
<text id="53001001">The dark soul of man...</text>
<text id="53001101">...</text>
<text id="53001102">...</text>
<text id="53001103">...</text>
<text id="53001104">...</text>
<text id="53001200">...</text>
<text id="53001300">Ashen One, I cannot die.</text>
<text id="53001301">I have a world to paint.</text>
<text id="72000000">Ashen One, thy gift of flame has taken root</text>
<text id="72000001">And Uncle Gael will soon bring the pigment.</text>
<text id="72000002">Pigment coloured like the dark soul of man.</text>
<text id="72000100">I wonder if Uncle Gael has found it?</text>
<text id="72000101">The pigment coloured like the dark soul of man...</text>
<text id="72000200">My thanks, Ashen One.</text>
<text id="72000201">With this will I paint a world. </text>
<text id="72000202">Please tell me thy name.</text>
<text id="72000203">I would name this painting after thee.</text>
<text id="72000300">My thanks. I will paint a world of that name.</text>
<text id="72000301">Twill be a cold, dark, and very gentle place.</text>
<text id="72000302">And one day, it will make someone a goodly home.</text>
<text id="72000400">I see. We are much alike.</text>
<text id="72000401">Twill be a cold, dark, and very gentle place.</text>
<text id="72000402">And one day, it will make someone a goodly home.</text>
<text id="72000403">Then I will name this painting "Ash".</text>
<text id="72000500">I wonder when Uncle Gael intends his return.</text>
<text id="72000501">I hope the new painting will be to him a gentle home.</text>
<text id="72000600">My thanks, Ashen One.</text>
<text id="72000601">I will assuredly finish the painting.</text>
<text id="72000602">Of a cold, dark, and very gentle place.</text>
<text id="72000603">One day, it will make someone a goodly home.</text>
